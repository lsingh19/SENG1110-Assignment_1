Object-Oriented Programming Course - Assignment 1
# Assignment Requirements
There must be three classes: Client, Account and LoanCalculator. 
  
  • The Account class (the file needs to be Account.java) 
 
It will hold the required instance data for an account and it will have suitable methods to access and modify the data for an account.  
 
The instance variables will be 
  • interestRate – double 
  • numberOfMonths – int 
  • amount – double 
  • accountType – String 

You need to implement at least one constructor, which will initialize the instance variables with values from parameters. The class needs to have methods to change and access all instance variables. It will also have the following methods (at least): 
 
  • setInterestRate, which will set the value in the interestRate which will depend on the type of the account (as explained above). 
  
  • calculateMontlyPayment, which will calculate the formula (1) 
  
  • setAmortizationTable - it will output a String with the table information.
